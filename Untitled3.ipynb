        "*   Events were filtered based on characteristics suggesting relevance for digital attendee engagement: multi-day, likely having 200+ attendees, multiple sessions, networking opportunities, attendee interaction, and B2B focus.\n",
        "*   Scraping individual event pages on bigevent.io using Playwright and BeautifulSoup proved challenging for extracting structured details like `expected_attendees`, specific contact information, and `organizer_url`, resulting in many `None` values for these fields.\n",
        "*   Basic email pattern validation was implemented and applied to the extracted emails.\n",
        "*   A check for the presence of webforms on event pages was implemented as an alternative contact channel indicator.\n",
        "*   A `confidence_score` was assigned and refined for each event based on how well it met the defined relevance criteria (timing, location, type, attendees, industry, duration), with a potential bonus for strong B2B indicators and points for valid email or webform availability.\n",
        "*   The final dataset was structured into a DataFrame with the required columns, and duplicate entries based on `event_url` were removed.\n",
        "*   The final dataset contains 19 unique events. However, key fields such as `expected_attendees`, `organizer_url`, `contact_name`, and `contact_role` have a high number of missing values.\n",
        "*   The `confidence_score` reflects the event's alignment with the relevance criteria, indicating which events are potentially strong leads based on the available data.\n",

        "*   Due to the difficulty in scraping `expected_attendees` and specific contact details (name, role, email, LinkedIn) from bigevent.io event pages, manual review or alternative data enrichment methods may be necessary for the most promising leads.\n",
        "*   Focus outreach efforts on events with a higher `confidence_score`, prioritizing those within the target timing and location, and explore alternative methods to find accurate attendee counts and direct contact information for these high-confidence events.\n"
